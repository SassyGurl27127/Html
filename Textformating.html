It involves using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user-facing front-end, and also includes back-end programming, database management, and server administration to ensure functionality, user experience, and security. The field is broadly divided into front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, with each focusing on different layers of the application.<br>
<b>Key components: Web development relies on fundamental technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 
Process: The development process typically involves defining project goals, planning, designing the user interface and experience, creating content, coding the site, thorough testing, and ongoing maintenance. 
Types of development: The field is often broken down into three main areas:</b> 
Front-end development: Focuses on the user interface and what users see and interact with directly. 
Back-end development: Manages the server-side logic, databases, and the "behind-the-scenes" functions that power the website.
